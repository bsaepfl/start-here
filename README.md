## The Blockchain


[Here](http://blockchain.mit.edu/how-blockchain-works/) is an awesome website to understand and interact with a blockchain.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4) is a great video on the topic.

To learn more about the why of Bitcoin: “The Internet of Money” (_Andrea M. Antonopoulos_) [vol.1](https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Money-Andreas-M-Antonopoulos/dp/1537000454) and [vol.2](https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Money-Andreas-M-Antonopoulos/dp/194791006X/). Very interesting and highly recommended.

Learn what [smart-contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) are.

[Here](https://ethereum.org/) is the Ethereum website, in which you will quickly understand what it is about.

[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) is a very ludic way of learning how to write ethereum smart contracts.

[The Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.zeppelin.solution) is a very ludic way of learning security in smart contracts

The [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

A must read to understand the Bitcoin protocol: [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Programming-Open-Blockchain/dp/1491954388/) (_Andrea M. Antonopoulos_)
